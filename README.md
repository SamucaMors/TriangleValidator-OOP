# Description
This project is an object-oriented implementation of a triangle validator program. It refactors the previous versions by using classes and objects to represent triangles, making the code more modular, reusable, and aligned with object-oriented design principles. The program checks if three sides can form a valid triangle based on the triangle inequality theorem, calculates its area using Heron's formula, and compares the areas of two triangles.

This is the third and final project in a series of three, showcasing an advanced-level implementation using Object-Oriented Programming.

## Features
- Represents each triangle as an object, encapsulating its properties and behaviors.
- Validates if the three sides can form a triangle.
- Calculates the area of a triangle using Heron's formula.
- Compares the areas of two triangles (Triangle X and Triangle Y) and determines which is larger.
- Refactored with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to use classes and objects for better organization and maintainability.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TriangleValidator-OOP.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd TriangleValidator-OOP
```
3. Compile the code:
```bash
javac Program.java
```
4. Run the program:
```bash
java Program
```
## Technologies
Java (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Explanation about OOP:
At this level, the code was refactored to use object-oriented programming (OOP), where validation and area calculation logic was encapsulated in a Triangle class, representing a triangle as an object with properties (sides) and behaviors (methods for validation and area calculation). This design makes code easier to maintain and expand.
